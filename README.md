# Corporate-Credit-Card-transaction-Analysis-and-Anomaly-Detection

Datasets contain corporate credit card transactions published by the London Borough of Barnet for different time periods. We chose this data because it is public and freely available, as well as it will allow you to simulate our daily work. 
Please make the following assumptions:
 
•         Service Area denotes the functional areas (organizational chart) within the Borough of Barnett
•         Account Description is the name of the general ledger account in which each transaction is recorded
•         Assume that Journal Date and Transaction Date are synonymous
•         Disregard JV Date because it is not relevant for this analysis
•         Assume that Total and JV Value are synonymous; these are the amount of each transaction

Our client, an Auditor, has approached us for the following work:
 
1.       She would like to get a summary view of the transactions for each Service Area. The summary view would include at least one visual representation of the transactions in such a way that she could compare them by quarter. Quarters are defined based on the calendar year (Q1 is January to March, Q2 April to June, etc.). She would also like a summary table with some relevant statistics (she says something along the lines of “transaction counts and averages”, but she welcomes ideas).
2.       She would like to get a view if there are any significant changes in spending behavior by Service Area and by Account. Changes in behavior could be spikes, but could also be permanent increases in the transaction amounts. Please identify instances of both or show that they do not exist in the data.
3.       In terms of spending behavior (defined by the number and the typical size of transactions), are there Service Areas that behave similarly and can be grouped together? Please explain the value of your grouping for the Auditor’s work.
4.       The auditor has heard that you may know anomaly detection techniques. She would like to ask you for a sample of a few hundred transactions that are anomalous, different or worthwhile inquiring about.  The sample should include at least five transactions for each Service Area. Please provide this sample, and explain why these transactions are special or different.
